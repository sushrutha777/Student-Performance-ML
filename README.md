# ðŸ§  Student Exam Performance Predictor

A full-stack machine learning web application to predict a student's math score based on their reading and writing scores, demographic information, and background. Built using Flask, Scikit-learn, and HTML5 with Bootstrap.

Features include: input form to collect student data (gender, ethnicity, test prep, scores, etc.), ML model pipeline to predict math score, data preprocessing using preprocessor.pkl, deployed locally via Flask, and a clean Bootstrap-based UI.

How to Run Locally:
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/sushrutha777/Student-Performance-ML.git
   cd student-score-predictor

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv mlenv
   mlenv\Scripts\activate     (on Windows)
   OR
   source mlenv/bin/activate  (on Mac/Linux)

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. (Optional) Train the model if artifacts are missing

5. Start the Flask application:
   python application.py

6. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000

Sample Input:
